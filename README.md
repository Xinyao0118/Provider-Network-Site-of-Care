# Provider Network Site of Care

##Abstract
To build a provider network for site of care about colonoscopy is of importance. The general idea is that I would like to find for each hospital in NY state, how many Ambulatory surgery Center*(ASC)* are nearby and suggest the insurance company to send the patients who planned to go to the hospital for colonoscopy to nearby Ambulatory surgery Center.
